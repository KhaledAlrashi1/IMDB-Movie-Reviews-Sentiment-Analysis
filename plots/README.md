# Plots Directory

Welcome to the `plots` directory of the Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews project!

## Overview

This folder contains various visualizations and plots that provide insights into the IMDB dataset and the performance of our sentiment analysis model. These plots play a crucial role in understanding the distribution of the data, the most frequent words in the reviews, and how well our model performs.

## Contents

- **Distribution of Reviews**: A histogram showcasing the number of positive and negative reviews in the dataset. This plot helps identify any class imbalance and provides a high-level overview of the sentiment distribution in the dataset.
  
- **Word Frequency**: A bar plot or word cloud showing the most frequent words in the reviews. This visualization offers insights into the most common terms in movie reviews and can help in feature engineering or data cleaning.
  
- **Model Performance**: Plots related to the model's training history, including accuracy and loss over epochs. These visualizations assist in diagnosing issues like overfitting or underfitting.
  
- **Review Length Distribution**: A histogram showing the distribution of review lengths. This can help understand the variation in review lengths and determine if longer reviews have a certain sentiment compared to shorter ones.
